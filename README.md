Created the basic HTML structure, defining the input field, the "Add" button, and the list container (<ul>).

Applied enhanced CSS styling to create a modern, compact user interface featuring soft shadows, rounded corners, and subtle hover effects.

Wrote JavaScript code to capture the input value and dynamically construct a new list item (<li>) when the "Add" button is clicked.

Used event delegation on the main list container to efficiently manage interactions for all current and future tasks.

Implemented task completion by using JavaScript to toggle the completed class (for strike-through) when a task is clicked.

Added functionality to instantly remove any task from the DOM using a dedicated "X" button.
